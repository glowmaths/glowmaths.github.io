                <h2>Which MathsNav should I use? </h2>
                    <p>
                            There are two versions available for Primary Schools - Primary v1.0 and CanDoMaths Nav. Responding to feedback from primary schools that have embraced the <a href="https://www.doittwistitsolveit.com/ ">‘#DoItSecureItDeepenIt’ ‘#DoItTwistItSolveIt’</a> lesson design structure, some of the KLPs and units in Primary v1.0 have been amended to make it even better! The new improved version - the CanDoMaths Nav - include the following changes: 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            -      All KLPs have been reviewed to ensure they are manageable steps to support children’s learning <br>
                            -      The new ‘Manageable Steps’ support teachers’ planning using the ‘DoItSecureItDeepenIt’ lesson design structure. <br>
                            -      Some KLPs were too large and they have been broken down into new smaller ‘Manageable Steps’.<br>
                            -      Additional units have been added to linger longer on important concepts for different year groups – e.g. focusing on securing number bonds up to 20 in Year 1, mental calculation strategies in Year 3, knowing the times tables in Years 3 and 4, decimals in Year 5.<br>
                            -      All units now have names that explicitly link to the National Curriculum Strands to support links with assessment and tracking<br>
                            -      Time for additional lessons explicitly focusing on solving problems have been integrated into the overview for the year in the CanDoMathsNav. The ‘solve problems to….’ KLPs that were not suitable for the ‘DoItSecureItDeepenIt’ lesson design structure have been removed from units<br>
                            -      The CanDoMathsNav is the only one that has been updated with the term dates for 2019/20 – and yes with these additions it is still all possible within the academic year!!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Note: Lesson plans and resources based on the Primary v1.0 will still be able to be used with the CanDoMaths Nav.
